# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
</br>
</br>
I programmed inside of CLion, because it has good support for C++ programs. I used to external libraries, both of with were
for working with the audio files. SDL2 and SDL_Mixer provide methods for manipulating audio files such as play, pause, and skip.
